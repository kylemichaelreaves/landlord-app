# FindYourLandlord, North Jersey

Built around the data in my landlord_data project: https://github.com/kylemichaelreaves/landlord_data

While we are starting out with Jersey City, I plan on expanding to other cities in North Jersey: Newark, Paterson, Hackensack.

If there's a city you'd like to see mapped please reach out to me. 

Using: React with TypeScript and mapboxGL
